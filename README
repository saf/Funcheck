============================

JimuvaChecker is an immutability checker based on the Jimuva type
system created within S. Rudnicki's M.Sc. thesis. 

* COMPILING

The Checker Framework, along with JimuvaChecker, needs to be compiled
prior to running by issuing the command 

  $ ant bindist

in the 'checkers' directory. 

* RUNNING

The Checker Framework contains its own instance of the Java compiler
javac. The simplest way to run JimuvaChecker is to run the following
command:

  $ ./javac -processor checkers.fun.jimuva.JimuvaChecker <file.java>

* EXAMPLES

The directory 'examples/checkers/fun/examples' contains a few example
files created in order to test JimuvaChecker.
