<h1>Type annotations FAQ</h1>

<p>
These are some common questions about the <a href="./">Type Annotations
(JSR 308)</a> extension to Java.  Feel free to
<a href="./#Support">suggest</a> improvements to the answers, or other
questions to include here.
</p>

<p>
<b>Before you read this FAQ</b>, please read either the
<a href="specification/java-annotation-design.html">Type Annotations
Specification</a> (if you are most interested in the language syntax) or
the
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html">Checker Framework Manual</a>
(if you are most interested in pluggable type-checking).  Then, if you
still have questions, you can see whether this FAQ answers them.

<!--
  Most answers should be short and should point people at the specification,
  so that we don't have to maintain two versions of an explanation.  This FAQ
  is useful for people who like to read them and in some sense it serves as
  an index into the specification, especially for things that don't have an
  obvious and easy-to-find place in the specification.

<h2 id="use">Usability of type annotations</h2>


<h3 id="usefulness">What are type annotations good for?</h3>

<p>
Type annotations make Java's annotation system more expressive and uniform.
Thus, they can be used for many of the same purposes as Java 5's
declaration annotations.
A new use is as type qualifiers.  Programmers can write these type
qualifiers in their programs, and then a compiler plug-in automatically
finds bugs.
</p>

<p>
No tool will solve all your problems, but pluggable type-checkers have been
shown to help programmers to rid their programs of certain important
classes of bugs, including null pointer errors, incorrect side effects,
incorrect equality tests, and more.
Users of the Checker Framework keep noticing new ways that pluggable
type-checkers are useful, and you probably will too.
</p>

<p>
For more details, see the
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html">Checker Framework Manual</a> and
also section
<a href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#type-qualifiers">Example
use of type annotations:  Type qualifiers</a> in the Type Annotations
Specification.
</p>


<h3 id="ease-of-use">Are type annotations easy to read and write?</h3>

<p>
The paper
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/pubs/pluggable-checkers-issta2008-abstract.html">Practical
pluggable types for Java</a> discusses case studies in which programmers
found type annotations to be natural to read and write.  The code
continued to feel like Java, and the type-checking errors were easy to
comprehend and often led to real bugs.
</p>

<p>
You don't have to take our word for it, though.  You can try the
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html">Checker Framework</a> for yourself.
</p>

<p>
The difficulty of adding and verifying annotations depends on your program.
If your program is well-designed and -documented, then skimming the
existing documentation and writing type annotations is extremely easy.
Otherwise, you may find yourself spending a lot of time trying to
understand, reverse-engineer, or fix bugs in your program, and then just a
moment writing a type annotation that describes what you discovered.  This
process inevitably improves your code.  You must decide whether it is a
good use of your time.  For code that is not causing trouble now and is
unlikely to do so in the future (the code is bug-free, and you do not
anticipate changing it or using it in new contexts), then the
effort of writing type annotations for it may not be justified.
</p>


<h3 id="clutter">Will my code become cluttered with type annotations?</h3>

<p>
As with any language feature, it is possible to write ugly code that
over-uses annotations.  However, in normal use, very few annotations need
to be written.  Figure 1 of the paper
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/pubs/pluggable-checkers-issta2008-abstract.html">Practical
pluggable types for Java</a> reports data for over 350,000 lines of
type-annotated code:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    1 annotation per 62 lines for nullness annotations (<tt>@NonNull</tt>, <tt>@Nullable</tt>, etc.)
    <!-- (/ (+ 4640 3961 10798) (+ 107 35 167)) -->
  </li>
  <li>
    1 annotation per 1736 lines for interning annotations (<tt>@Interned</tt>)
    <!-- (/ 224048 129) -->
  </li>
  <li>
    1 annotation per 27 lines for immutability annotations (IGJ type system)
    <!-- (/ (+ 6236 18159 30507 8691 59221 26828) (+ 315 1125 1386 384 1815 450)) -->
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Furthermore, these numbers are for annotating existing code.  New code that
is written with the type annotation system in mind is cleaner and more
correct, so it requires even fewer annotations.
</p>

<p>
In other words, annotations do not clutter code, and they are used much
less frequently than generic types, which Java programmers find acceptable.
</p>


<h2 id="pluggable-types">Pluggable type-checking</h2>


<p>
Pluggable type-checking is a motivating application for type annotations.
The Java specification for type annotations does not define any pluggable
type-checkers; a pluggable type-checker is a separate tool.
</p>

<p>
There is a separate 
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#faq">FAQ for pluggable type-checking</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="language">Java language status</h2>


<h3 id="inclusion-in-java">Are type annotations part of the Java language?</h3>

<p>
Type annotations will be a part of the Java 7 language.
</p>

<p>
The Type Annotations Specification (also known by its Sun codename "JSR
308") has not yet received official final approval.  That is a formality:
language JSRs are never approved until the last moment before a Java
language release, just in case they need to change.  (It is very difficult
to change a language JSR once it has been officially approved.)  The Type
Annotations Specification is already quite stable, and explicitly notes the
few places where expansion or enhancement is needed.
</p>

<p>
An indication of Sun's support of type annotations is that
as of build b64 (publicly released on July 9, 2009), Sun's OpenJDK supports
type annotations.
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk7/milestones/">M4</a> was the first milestone release that contained this support.
(The Type Annotations Compiler is a variant of the OpenJDK compiler with
some extra features for compatibility with non-Java-7 compilers.  It is
distributed <a href="./">standalone</a> or as part of the
<a href="../checker-framework/">Checker Framework</a>.)
</p>


<h3 id="checkers-in-java">Is pluggable type-checking (such as supported by the Checker Framework) included in JSR 308 or the Java language?</h3>

<p>
The Java language defines an annotation processing capability (JSR 269).
Using this capability, it is possible to write annotation processors that
read and process all sorts of annotations, including type annotations.
Pluggable type-checking is one sort of annotation processing.
</p>

<p>
Pluggable type-checking would be impractical without the Type Annotations
(JSR 308) language syntax.  Given the new syntax, pluggable type-checking
can be implemented entirely by libraries, and there is no need for it to be
an official part of the Java language.  The
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html">Checker Framework</a> is an example
of a library that enables you to create and use pluggable type-checkers.
</p>

<p>
The Checker Framework is an independent tool and
not a part of the Type Annotations proposal.  The Checker Framework
distribution includes the Type Annotations compiler for convenience, so
that users only have to download and install one file.
</p>


<h3 id="license">What is the license for the Type Annotations specification?</h3>

<p>
The Type Annotations specification is freely available without any license,
from the <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/">Type Annotations
webpage</a>.  The specification places no restriction on compliant
implementations.
</p>

<p>
An <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr308/">earlier
version</a> of the Type Annotations specification was published during an
Early Draft Review (EDR) of JSR 308.  The license used for the EDR contains
certain restrictions.  Obtaining the specification from the
<a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/">Type Annotations
webpage</a> does not impose any restrictions.
Furthermore, it is more up-to-date than the EDR version, which is dated
November 5, 2007.
</p>



<h2 id="tools">Tool support</h2>


<h3 id="backward-compatibility">Can I use type annotations even though my coworkers/boss/users don't use type annotations or Java 7?</h3>

<p>
You can use type annotations and custom type-checkers even if your
coworkers and users do not use custom type-checkers or the Type Annotations
compiler.  You simply write the annotations in comments and use the Type
Annotations compiler, which recognizes comments containing type
annotations.  Other developers can compile the annotated code using any
Java compiler, which will ignore the type annotations.  The Type
Annotations compiler produces bytecodes that are identical to those
produced by javac, so the <tt>.class</tt> files can be used in any JVM.
This also gives you an easy way to convince your colleagues to try type
annotations and the Checker Framework, or to use the framework and the
checkers even if your colleagues do not want to.
For more details, see section
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#annotations-in-comments">Writing
annotations in comments for backward compatibility</a> in the Checker
Framework Manual.
</p>


<h3 id="openjdk">What is the relationship between the Type Annotations compiler and the OpenJDK compiler?</h3>

<p>
Oracle's announced plan is to incorporate all of the changes in the Type
Annotations compiler into the OpenJDK compiler, with the exception of the
<a href="../README-jsr308.html#annotations-in-comments">annotations in comments
  feature</a>.  The Oracle process for incorporating changes into OpenJDK is
a lengthy one, so sometimes it takes a while before improvements to the
Type Annotations compiler appear in OpenJDK.
</p>

<p>
Periodically, all public changes to the OpenJDK compiler are merged into
the Type Annotations compiler.  This can be done relatively easily, and
without corporate approval required.
</p>

<p>
As a result, at any moment each compiler may have features the other one
lacks.  In general, you are better off using the Type Annotations compiler,
particularly if you are interested in writing and checking type annotations.
</p>

<p>
For a more detailed description of the differences between the two
compilers, see the <a href="../README-jsr308.html#openjdk-differences">Type
    Annotations compiler README file</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="platforms">Do the Type Annotations tools run on Linux?  MacOS?  Windows?</h3>

<p>
We have had successful reports from users of Linux, MacOS, and Windows.  If you
have trouble installing or running the tools, please report a bug.  The
<a href="./#Support">Support</a> section of the <a href="./">Type
Annotations webpage</a> explains how.
</p>


<h3 id="eclipse">Do IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA support type annotations?</h3>

<p>
Yes, several IDEs support type annotations, and more IDEs are being
extended to support type annotations.  See the 
<a href="../checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#running">Running a checker</a> section of the
Checker Framework Manual.
</p>


<h3 id="bug-reporting">How do I file a bug report?</h3>

<p>
See the <a href="./#Support">Support</a> section of the <a href="./">Type
Annotations webpage</a>.
</p>


<!-- This is duplicated in the Checker Framework FAQ. -->
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax of type annotations</h2>


<h3 id="return-type">Does an annotation before a method refer to the return type or to the method?</h3>

<p>
An annotation before a method sometimes refers to the return type, and
sometimes to the method itself.  There is never any ambiguity regarding
which is intended.  See section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#disambiguating">Disambiguating
type and declaration annotations</a> in the Type Annotations specification.
</p>


<h3 id="array-syntax-meaning">What is the meaning of array annotations such as <tt>@NonNull Object @Nullable []</tt>?</h3>

<p>
<tt>@NonNull Object @Nullable []</tt> is a possibly-null array of non-null
objects.  Note that even though the first token in the type is
&ldquo;<tt>@NonNull</tt>&rdquo;, that annotation applies to the element
type <tt>Object</tt>.  The annotation <tt>@Nullable</tt> applies to the
array (<tt>[]</tt>).
</p>

<p>
Similarly,
<tt>@Nullable Object @NonNull []</tt> is a non-null array of possibly-null
objects.
</p>


<h3 id="array-syntax">I don't like array and receiver annotations.</h3>

<p>
If you are skeptical of the <em>usefulness</em> of the annotations, see
section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#type-annotation-use-cases">Uses
for annotations on types</a> in the Type Annotations specification.
</p>

<p>
If you are skeptical of the <em>syntax</em> of <em>array annotations</em>, then
perhaps you really don't like Java's array syntax.  The annotation
extension is a logical extension of Java's syntax; see section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#array-syntax">Syntax of
array annotations</a> in the Type Annotations specification.
</p>

<p>    
If you are skeptical of the <em>syntax</em> of <em>receiver annotations</em>,
then see section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#receivers">Receivers</a> in
the Type Annotations specification.
</p>

<p>
While these annotations are critical in important circumstances, they are
fairly rare in well-written code.  And
<em>you</em> don't have to use them if you don't want to.
</p>


<h2 id="features">Features in the Type Annotations specification</h2>


<h3 id="type-of-an-object">How do I determine the annotation on an object?</h3>

<p>
Objects are not annotated &mdash; types or declarations are.
Java has no run-time representation of the types of the variables that
refer to an object.  The Type Annotations specification (JSR 308) enriches
types, but it does not change that fundamental property.  Type annotations
as implemented in JSR 308 have no run-time representation.  This means that
they impose no run-time burden on Java programs that use them.
</p>

<p>
Reflective calls can query the class of an object, or can query the type
annotations on source code.
</p>


<h3 id="statement_annotations">Is there a way to annotate statements?</h3>

<p>
Statement annotations are within the scope of JSR 308, and this feature is
under consideration.  See the section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#statement-annotations">Annotations on Statements</a> in the Type Annotations specification.
</p>

<h3 id="feature-x">Should the Type Annotations specification support feature <em>X</em>?</h3>

<p>
Perhaps it should.  See section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#other-annotations">Other
possible extensions to Java annotations</a> in the Type Annotations
Specification.  Feel free to suggest modifications or additions to that
section.  Your edits should correct factual errors, or should be
well-motivated by compelling use-cases that cannot be achieved by other
means.
</p>


<h3 id="specific-annotations">Why doesn't the Type Annotations specification define annotations such as <tt>@NonNull</tt>?</h3>

<p>
Defining annotations is beyond the scope of the Type Annotations
Specification, whose purpose is to lay the groundwork so that others can
define such types.
</p>


<h3 id="jsr305">What is the relationship between JSR 308 and JSR 305?</h3>

<p>
Type Annotations (JSR 308) is a language extension that makes existing and
future annotations more useful to programmers.  By contrast, Annotations
for Software Defect Detection (JSR 305) defines some specific annotations,
such as <tt>@Nonnull</tt> and <tt>@Positive</tt>.  The JSR 305 annotations
are most useful if they can be written on types, so JSR 305 needs JSR 308
to achieve its full potential.  For a more detailed comparison, see section
<a href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#semantics">Semantics of
annotations</a> in the Type Annotations specification.
</p>


<!--
 Perhaps discuss other tools:  JastAdd, JavaCOP, etc.  The problem is
 that none of them scales, and thus none of them is of practical use at
 present.  But I don't really want to criticize them in this document, for
 political reasons.
-->


<h3 id="modifying-the-specification">Is the Type Annotations specification set in stone?</h3>

<p>
The Type Annotations (JSR 308) expert group gladly welcomes suggestions for improvements to
the Type Annotations specification, and to the tools that support it.  See
section <a
href="specification/java-annotation-design.html#other-annotations">Other
possible extensions to Java annotations</a> in the Type Annotations
Specification.
</p>


<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3 id="jsr">What does &ldquo;JSR&rdquo; mean?</h3>

<p>
A JSR, or Java Specification Request, is a proposed specification for some
aspect of the Java platform &mdash; the Java language, virtual machine,
libraries, etc.  For more details, see the
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/introduction/faq">Java Community Process
FAQ</a>.  Many people refer to the Type Annotations specification by its
Sun codename, &ldquo;JSR 308&rdquo;.
