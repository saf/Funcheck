Adding a new target_type
------------------------

Whenever a new target_type is added to the specification in:
  design.tex
(which is on the web as
http://types.cs.washington.edu/jsr308/specification/java-annotation-design.html#class-file:ext:target_type )
the following needs to be done to fully incorporate it into the rest of the
system.

   - Update the annotation index file specification at
       annotations/doc/annotation-file-format.tex
     This will appear on the web the next time the Annotation File
     Utilities are distributed.
   - Incorporate it into the annotation scene library in the correct 
       manner (depending on the target_type) at annotations/scene-lib
   - Update the parser and writer as specified by the above two points
   - Update the asmx classfile parser to read the new attribute:
       annotations/asmx/src/org/objectweb/asm/ClassReader.java
   - Writing to classfile for extended annotations only requires modifying
       annotations/asmx/src/org/objectweb/asm/ExtendedAnnotationWriter.java
   - Modify the asmx extended annotation interface:
       annotations/asmx/src/org/objectweb/asm/ExtendedAnnotationVisitor.java
       Making this change will reveal all the remaining places where other
       changes might be necessary.
   - Update the annotator (.jaif -> .java) to understand the new type:
	    annotations/annotator
